I used python3.6 in this project.

The folder contains 3 files:
the parser, the lexer and the makefile.

The parser is importing the lexer.
The parser contains the functions required for the 2048 game as well as the functions which are tied in with the parser functions.

To run the program, go to ubuntu terminal, navigate to the directory containing the 3 files, and type the command 'make' in the terminal.

To exit the program, type the string 'exit' in the program prompt.

If the makefile does not run, directly run the parser file.
